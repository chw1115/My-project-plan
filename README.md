# Proposal (Level 3 Heading)

---

I am planning to make a computer vision software that detects an object in images.
In order to build it, I will use opencv, deep learning libraries, such as [Tensorflow](Tensorflow.org) or [Pytorch](Pytorch.org), and other open source softwares.

For example, the object in the following images were detected using [mmdetection](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection):

  - tensorflow
  - oprnmmlab
  - package manager

### Installation

In a bash terminal, run the following commands (*Do Not actually run these commands in your computer*):

```sh
$ sudo apt update
$ conda create -n cv_detection
$ conda activate cv_detection
